// in this first lecture we have only seen this 
-first i will be creating an index file in html with structure and deploying that file on github and making it live on netlify 
..

1 - create an html file and save it with an extension of .html or .hml

     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
     <title> Basic things </title>
     </head>
     <body>
      <h1> Hi Everyone</h1>
     </body>
     </html>

     So we have created our first index.html file 

     2- now make a repository on gothub and upload it  using these commmand 
        - git init (to initialise github jisse ki ek .git folder banjayega )
        - copy repo link from gothub and paste after this command 
        - git remote add origin (cpoied link)
        - now staging process matlab upload karne se pehle files ko ready karna  using add . command
        - now commit by using git commit -m "message"
        - now push on gothub by this command git push origin master 

        we have sussesfully uploaded our files on gothub 

      3- now to make it live we will use netlify
         - create an account on netlify 
         - connect with github
         - automatically your files from github will bne fetched select it and start deploying 
         - once deployed you will ghet a link (live now)
         - now if you want to change the domain then go to domain and change site name 

    ------------------------------------------------
    see you soon !!
